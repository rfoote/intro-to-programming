Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

I looked at:

ruby-doc.org (This is the one I have been using for reference)

rubydoc.info

apidock.com/ruby/browse (This one allows users to add notes/examples)

guides.rubyonrails.org

api.rubyonrails.org


For now, since I've only been using Ruby (not Rails), I like the site I've been using as a reference: ruby-doc.org 
It's easy to find information I need on this site.

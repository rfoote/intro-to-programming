Exercise 4: What will the following code print to the screen?

This code does not print anything to the screen, because there is a return statement before the "puts" inside the scream method.
Therefore, the puts words expression is not evaluated.


Exercise 5: Edit the method so that it does print words on the screen. What does it return now?

After editing it so that it does print words on the screen (by taking out "return"), it returns nil.


Exercise 6: The error message tells me that the wrong number of arguments was used when calling the "calculate_product" method (one instead of two).
